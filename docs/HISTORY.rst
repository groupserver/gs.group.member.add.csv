The early ``gs.profile.invite`` code was later turned into
`gs.profile.invite.csv`_. This was forked to create this product.
The change history of this product prior to 2012-05-12 was lost
due to an odd history corruption error:

    I've… seen things you people wouldn't believe… Attack ships
    on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter
    in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those… moments…
    will be lost in time, like [small cough] tears… in…
    rain. Time… to die…

    — Rutger Hauer (as Roy Batty), Blade Runner, 1982

Except you can still see them in `the Invite changelog`_.
